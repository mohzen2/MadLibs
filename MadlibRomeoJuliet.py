 In fair {Place}, where we lay our scene,\
 From ancient {Noun2} break to new mutiny,\
 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\
 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes.\
 A pair of star-cross`d {Noun3} take their life;\
 Whole misadventured piteous overthrows\
 Do with their {Noun4} bury their parents` strife.\
 The fearful passage of their {Adj1} love,\
 And the continuance of their parents` rage,\
 Which, but their children`s end, nought could {Verb1},\
 Is now the Number hours` traffic of our stage;\
 The which if you with {Adj2} Body Part attend,\
 What here shall {Verb2}, our toil shall strive to mend."
